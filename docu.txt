LOAN PREDICTION MODEL DOCUMENTATION
===================================

1. PREDICTION LOGIC & CALCULATIONS
----------------------------------
The model is a **Gradient Boosting Classifier** trained on historical loan data.
It takes user input and converts it into a numerical vector of 12 features before prediction.

Preprocessing Logic:
- **Gender**: Male = 1, Female = 0
- **Married**: Yes = 1, No = 0
- **Dependents**: Direct mapping ('0'->0, '1'->1, '2'->2, '3+'->3)
- **Education**: Graduate = 0, Not Graduate = 1
- **Self_Employed**: Yes = 1, No = 0
- **Property_Area**: One-Hot Encoded (Semiurban=1/0, Urban=1/0)
- **Income & Loan**: Passed as numeric values.

2. INPUT SCALING & LOAN-TO-INCOME RATIO
---------------------------------------
Crucially, the model expects inputs in specific units based on the training dataset.

* **Applicant Income**: Verified Monthly Income (e.g., 5000 means $5,000).
* **Loan Amount**: In **THOUSANDS**. (e.g., 150 means $150,000).

The "Loan to Income" ratio is calculated implicitly by the Gradient Boosting trees, but mathematically it looks like this:
   
   Ratio = (Loan Amount * 1000) / (Monthly Income * Term)

However, the model often learns simpler heuristics, effectively capping the Loan Amount absolute value regardless of income.

3. WHY WERE INPUTS REJECTED?
----------------------------
Most rejections encountered were due to **Unit Mismatches** (Scaling Issues).

Case 1: User Argument
- User Input: Income 200,000 | Loan 2,000,000
- Model Interpretation: Income $200k/mo | Loan $2 BILLION (2000000 * 1000).
- Result: **REJECTED** (Extreme Outlier).

Case 2: User Argument (Corrected Ratio, High Values)
- User Input: Income 60,000 | Loan 2,000 
- Interpretation: Income $60k/mo | Loan $2 Million.
- Result: **REJECTED**.
- Reason: Although the ratio is healthy, a Loan Amount of '2000' is an anomaly. The model was trained on loans typically between 100-300. Values > 500 are often penalized heavily by the decision trees.

4. OPTIMAL INPUT VALUES FOR APPROVAL
------------------------------------
To get an approval, inputs must usually stay within the "Typical Distribution" of the training data.

Standard Approval Profile:
-------------------------
- **Applicant Income**: 5000  ($5,000/mo)
- **Loan Amount**:      150   ($150,000)
- **Credit History**:   1.0   (Good)
- **Loan Term**:        360   (30 Years)

High Income Profile (Limit):
---------------------------
- **Applicant Income**: 10,000 - 20,000
- **Loan Amount**:      250 - 600
- **Credit History**:   1.0

Maximum Detected Limits:
------------------------
- Max Income tested: ~50,000
- Max Loan tested:   ~950  (Approaching 1 Million)

Any Loan Amount entered above **1000** is highly likely to be rejected regardless of income.
